# Skills

This repository contains
[skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512176-what-are-skills) for
use with marimo.

## Quickstart

Install these skills with:

```
npx skills add marimo-team/skills
```

The benefit of `npx skills` is that it supports [many many agents](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-agents). So you can do things like:

```
npx skills add marimo-team/skills --agent claude-code
npx skills add marimo-team/skills --agent opencode
```

## What are skills?

Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources
that Claude (and many other agents) loads dynamically to improve performance on
specialized tasks.
